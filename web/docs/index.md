# index.html
This HTML document represents a simple webpage with a search form and buttons for searching playlists and creating new playlists. The actual functionality for searching playlists and displaying the results is handled by the JavaScript file "searchPlaylists.js" linked in the head section. The CSS file "style.css" is used for styling the webpage elements.

[index.html](index.html) is a default filename commonly used for the main entry point or default page of a website or web application. When a web server receives a request to serve a directory (e.g., http://example.com/), it looks for an index.html file in that directory and automatically serves it as the default page.

The index.html file is typically an HTML document that defines the structure and content of the webpage. It may include links to CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other assets, as well as the main content that users will see when they visit the website.

The use of index.html as the default page simplifies website navigation and allows users to access the main content of the site without specifying a specific filename in the URL. It is a widely followed convention in web development and is supported by most web servers by default.


This HTML document represents a webpage for searching playlists. Let's break down the different sections of the HTML:

## 1. Document Type Declaration:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
This line specifies that the document is an [HTML5](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/HTML5) document.

## 2. HTML Structure:
```html
<html>
<head>
    <!-- The head section contains metadata and external resource links -->
</head>
<body class="background">
    <!-- The body section contains the visible content of the webpage -->
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. Head Section:
The `<head>` section contains metadata and external resource links used in the webpage.

- JavaScript Source:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/searchPlaylists.js"></script>
```
This line links an external JavaScript file named "searchPlaylists.js". Notice this file is not located in the "assets" folder. Instead it's under "src/pages". When using [Webpack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intro-to-webpack-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-8304ecdc3c60/), the references to JavaScript (JS) files from an HTML file might not match the original source path. This discrepancy occurs because Webpack transforms and bundles multiple JavaScript files into a single output file during the build process. This searchPlaylists.js file is responsible for handling the functionality related to searching playlists.


- CSS Style:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
```
This line links an external CSS file named "style.css" located in the "css" folder. The CSS file is responsible for styling the visual elements of the webpage.

4. Body Section:
The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage.

- Background Class:
```html
<body class="background">
```
The `<body>` element has a class attribute "background" applied to it. This class is used to set a background style for the entire webpage.

- Header:
```html
<header class="header" id="header"></header>
```
This is the header section of the webpage. It has a class "header" applied to it and an "id" attribute set to "header". The header is dynamically by JavaScript.

- Search Form:
```html
<div class="card">
    <h2>Search Playlists</h2>
    <form class="card-content" id="search-playlists-form">
        <!-- Form content -->
    </form>
    <!-- Buttons -->
</div>
```
This is a search form contained within a card element with class "card". The form has an ID "search-playlists-form". It includes a heading "Search Playlists" and a text input field with a label "Search by name or tag". There is also a subtext that provides additional instructions for the search.

- Buttons:
```html
<p class="button-group">
    <a href="#" class="button" id="search-btn">Search</a>
    <a href="createPlaylist.html" class="button">New Playlist</a>
</p>
```
This section contains two buttons. The first button has an ID "search-btn" and is used to trigger the search functionality. The second button links to another page named "createPlaylist.html", where users can create a new playlist.

- Search Results Container:
```html
<div class="card hidden" id='search-results-container'>
    <h3>Results for <span id="search-criteria-display"></span></h3>
    <div id="search-results-display">
    </div>
</div>
```
This is a container for displaying search results, but it is initially hidden because of the "hidden" class. The container has an ID "search-results-container". Inside the container, there is a heading "Results for" followed by a `<span>` element with ID "search-criteria-display", where the search criteria will be displayed. The search results themselves will be populated inside the `<div>` with ID "search-results-display" when the search is performed.
